        <p>Former Executive Creative Director at BBDO New York. I oversaw Snickers and Mars petcare brands with my former partner Peter Kain. We created the “You’re not you when you’re hungry” campaign for Snickers. It began with the 2010 admeter-winning commercial starting Betty White, and has since gone on to win every major award from Cannes Lions to Effies, while helping Snickers grow from the #7 to #1 global chocolate bar. Most recently, we won the One Show Penta award, honoring long term client-agency relationships and we picked up our second Super Clio for 2020’s “Fix the World” Super Bowl campaign.</p>
        <p>I also worked on US and global advertising for Mars petcare brands, including Pedigree’s Dogs on Zoom campaign to facilitate dog adoption during quarantine. During our tenure at BBDO, Peter and I wrote and oversaw award winning work for FedEx, Mountain Dew, Twix, and others. </p>
        <p>Currently freelancing and enjoying more time with my family.</p>
